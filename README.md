# Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

This Python project utilizes BeautifulSoup to scrape data from the [Corredor Promedio Calendar](https://www.corredorpromedio.com/calendario/), extracting information about upcoming races. The script fetches details such as race title, date, duration, and location, presenting the data in a CSV file (`CarrerasDataSet.csv`). The process is automated and can be scheduled to run at intervals, ensuring the dataset is continually updated.

Additionally, there's a provision to send email notifications with the latest race information. The script demonstrates a practical use case for web scraping, data manipulation with pandas, and automation for real-time data updates.
